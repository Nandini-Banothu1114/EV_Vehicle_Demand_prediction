        "As electric vehicle (EV) adoption surges, urban planners need to anticipate infrastructure needs—especially charging stations. Inadequate planning can lead to bottlenecks, impacting user satisfaction and hindering sustainability goals.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Problem Statement:** Using the electric vehicle dataset (which includes information on EV populations, vehicle types, and possibly historical charging usage), create a model to forecast future EV adoption. For example, predict the number of electric vehicles in upcoming years based on the trends in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Goal:** Build a regression model that forecasts future EV adoption demand based on historical trends in EV growth, types of vehicles, and regional data.\n",
